# sneezebot
## Usage

Slack exclusively an integer to have that many sneezes added to you
Slack "[Name] [Integer]" to have that many sneezes added to that person
So we can all add sneezes for all of us. I figure we won't be abusing the power but I can make it more restrictive if this does not prove conducive to accurate tracking
Supported names are all of ours as they're rendered in the current tracker, plus "DC" and "K"
